## Documentation

This repository's [`publish-documentation`](https://github.com/qasim/Flock/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml) workflow job generates documentation pages via [DocC](https://www.swift.org/documentation/docc). These pages are then pushed to [`/Documentation/public`](https://github.com/qasim/Flock/tree/docs/Documentation/public) on the [`docs`](https://github.com/qasim/Flock/tree/docs) branch and served at [flock.qas.im](https://flock.qas.im) via [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
